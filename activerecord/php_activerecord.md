# 从 php ActiveRecord 找灵感

## 简介

php-activerecord is an open source ORM library based on the ActiveRecord pattern. It aims to massively simplify the interactions with your database and eliminate the chore of hand written SQL for common operations. Unlike other ORMs, you do not need to use any code generators nor maintain mapping files for your tables. This library was inspired by Ruby on Rails' implementation and therefore borrows many of its conventions and ideas. The best place to get started is by checking out the Guides below! The library is licensed under the MIT License and so you are completely free to do whatever you want with it.
